Implementation of a Dynamic Array in C

A common issue when using an Array in C is that the memory is normally fixed at compilation. However, a Dynamic Array is a solution to this problem. The Dynamic Array is created in order to allocate memory as the size of the array grows, therefore, we are not limited to whatever the capacity is at compilation.
